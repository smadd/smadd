# Well hello! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Smadd/Smadd/master/Cliply_co_wave.gif" width="30px" height="30px"> 

**I'm Stephanie. Welcome to my GitHub!**

:chart_with_upwards_trend:I'm currently learning Web Development skills and hoping to build on previous Data Science training. 

:earth_americas:I hope to blend my fascination with the natural world and human behavior in a mission to make the world a kinder, safer, more equitable place. While making an impact for various causes along the way in person, I am now shifting my focus to the tech world to find connections, solve problems, and improve lives, digitally.

:star2: Looking forward to creating new projects which I will showcase here. Thanks for your time!
